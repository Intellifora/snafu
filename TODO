All function calls are currently performed anonymously without
authentication, making Snafu suitable primarily for experiments,
prototyping and internal use. Future versions will offer authentication
through 'snafu-control' and perhaps through the web connector as well.

Functions implemented in Python 2 and in other programming languages are
currently not supported. This may be changed by the introduction of
external launchers, at the cost of higher call overhead.

Some clients (notably awscli) close connections and open new ones while
functions are still running without any chance to report back their
results. Snafu would have to clean up the sockets in CLOSE_WAIT state.

Asynchronous invocations are not supported at all at the moment.
