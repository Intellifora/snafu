All function calls are currently performed anonymously without
authentication, making Snafu suitable primarily for experiments,
prototyping and internal use. Future versions will offer authentication
through 'snafu-control' and perhaps through the web connector as well.

 -> snafu-control part has been solved

Functions implemented in Python 2 and in other programming languages are
currently not supported. This may be changed by the introduction of
external launchers, at the cost of higher call overhead.

The isolation level offered with --isolation is weak. A medium-level
protection could be achieved by running snafu slaves in separate
containers with mounted tenant function directories.

 -> proxy and docker executors added

Some clients (notably awscli) close connections and open new ones while
functions are still running without any chance to report back their
results. Snafu would have to clean up the sockets in CLOSE_WAIT state
immediately to avoid hitting the fd limit.

 -> reaper mode implemented, but no mapping yet to running threads

Some rather often used methods are not yet implemented in snafu-control,
notably update-function-*. Likewise, versioning is not yet supported.

 -> update-* is now implemented

Asynchronous invocations are not supported at all at the moment.
